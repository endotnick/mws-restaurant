### Installation:
Clone the repository and build the project. Images are generated using gulp, so you'll need the gulp-cli installed locally (https://gulpjs.com/).

    git clone https://github.com/endotnick/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git
    npm install
    gulp build
### Launch a webserver on port 8000:

    python3 -m http.server 8000
